# Documentation: Parsing Trace Files and Visualizing Data in Grafana

## Overview
This process involves parsing trace files, storing the extracted data in an SQLite3 database, and visualizing the data in Grafana on a localhost setup. Below is an explanation of how it was accomplished.

---

## Step 1: Parsing Trace Files
A custom script was developed to read and process trace files. The script extracted key information from these files and structured it for further use. The primary goal was to transform raw trace file data into a structured format that could be easily stored in a database. 

---

## Step 2: Creating an SQLite3 Database
Using the command line, an SQLite3 database was created to store the processed data. A table was defined within the database to organize the data into meaningful fields such as timestamps, values, and descriptions.

---

## Step 3: Inserting Data into the Database
The script inserted the processed data into the SQLite3 database. Each data entry from the trace file was stored as a row in the database, ensuring it was ready for querying and visualization.

---

## Step 4: Setting Up Grafana
Grafana, a popular open-source visualization tool, was installed and set up to work with the database. 

1. **Data Source Configuration:**  
   Grafana was configured to recognize the SQLite3 database as a data source. This involved specifying the path to the database file and setting up the connection within Grafana's settings.

2. **Local Access:**  
   Grafana was run on localhost, allowing access to the dashboard through a web browser.

---

## Step 5: Creating a Dashboard
1. A dashboard was created in Grafana to display the data visually.
2. Different panels were added to the dashboard, each representing specific data visualizations (e.g., time series, bar charts, or tables).
3. Queries were written within Grafana to fetch the required data from the SQLite3 database and populate the panels.

---

## Step 6: Running the Setup
1. The SQLite3 database was updated with parsed data using the script.
2. Grafana was started locally, and the dashboard was loaded to display the visualized data in real time.
3. The setup allowed seamless monitoring and analysis of the trace file data through an interactive interface.

## Outcome
This process provided a complete pipeline for processing raw trace files, storing the data, and creating an intuitive visualization platform. It enabled better insights and data-driven decision-making.
